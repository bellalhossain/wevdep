### Introduction

In this project we are using Django Web Framework to create an E-commerce site and I hope you can be able to replicate the source code in your own project. Here are some of the features that are included in this project:

### Contact form

We have implemented fully functioning contact form in this project. Itâ€™s very important for any websites out there to give ability to site visitors a way to send a message. We have implemented that feature in this project, you can learn how to send message from Django app to your inbox using SMTP.

### Authentication

We have implemented fully functioning authentication in this project. The user of website will be able to sign up on to you system, visit their profile page and finally logout. Depending on project, you can tweak this part based on your requirements.

### Stripe Connection

As we said earlier that this is an implementation of an E-commerce site, you want to provide a way for users to pay for the services. This project is connected to stripe and even better, when the user signs up on you system. We use Django signal to create a profile that has stripe id associated with that user.

### Crispy Forms
